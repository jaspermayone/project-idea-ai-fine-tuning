When people first actually made a compiler, they coded in raw binary. Then, they wrote a new compiler in that language and fed it through the old one. Like this, they improved compilers into what they are now. Now, when people make compilers they depend on LLVM or another lang or something. I want someone to exactly simulate the absolute start, with raw binary and compilers being fed into compilers.",
